         <h2>Tennis Bubbles</h2>
         <p>Twice a year the huge domes covering tennis courts need to be manipulated.
            I've never done this before. I found the job on Craigslist and then worked
            with a temp agency to get the details. I sent them my resume, provided my SIN, 
            address, and birthdate over the phone.
         </p>
         <p>I arrived on site at 8am. There were about 20 of us. The variety of people was 
            interesting. Migrants, students, retirees, office workers, transient workers, return
            workers, and some people who were just loafing around.
         </p>
         <p>I finished at 5pm, earning $22/hr + overtime.</p><br>
         <h3>Day 2</h3>
         <p>Much of the same today, but the fabric of the bubble was easier to work with. The skin 
            in front of my knuckle has worn off from friction and I'll be wearing bandaids for a 
            few days. If I do this again next year, and I hope I do, I'll tape up those digits
            with climbing tape to prevent that happening again.
        </p>
        <p>Good experience. I have some thoughts on how to improve the process. 
        </p>
        <p>Thanks Kirk, Linden, and Lauren.</p>

       <h2>Doordashing by Bike</h2>
       <p>I ordered a new red card so I can start delivering food for hungry people again. Expecting to 
        get around $20/hr for this.
       </p>
       <h4>September 21st</h4>
        <h2>Website</h2>
        <p>I feel lucky with this one. I started learning CSS/HTML last weekend, and last night
            someone posted an ad on Craigslist looking for a web developer to build a site
            using Squarespace for $500. Perfect. 
        </p>
        <p>I really want this. I woke up unusually early, so I used the time to
            start buiding a mock site before going to the Tennis Bubble job. After a
            couple early mornings and some evening work, I have something and know some things about 
            Squarespace.
        </p>
        <h3>Day 3</h3>
        <p>I talked to the client today after sharing my mock up. Good news! Hopefully this goes ok.</p>
        <p>I didn't have to work today, so I spent all day trying to make something that looks good. Grateful
            for my IT experience since I generally know that when there is a problem, a solution
            is probably only a few hours away.
        </p>
        <h4>September 24th</h4>
        <h2>Concrete Form Demolition and Cleanup</h2>
        <p>It's 5am as I write this. I think my internal clock is off. I've responded to an 
            ad on Craigslist asking for help doing some construction type of work. They posted it 
            late last night asking for help today. I'm asking for $20/hr. I hope this comes through since I'm ahead of
            schedule on the website, and in case the website client flakes at least I'll have made some 
            other money.
        </p>
        <h4>September 24th</h4>
        <h2>Business Writer</h2>
        <p>This is another Craigslist ad. It's odd. Here's the text:</p>
        <q>I think our virtual home show platform www.amvideoclassifiedsglobal.com is worth over $1 billion
            dollars - seeking to hire a business writer that lives in Vancouver so I can be interviewed in person, 
            understands how to value a company and write a great story. 
            The story will be featured content in major newspapers. Will be about 900 words
            To apply please send resume, some stories you written in the past and contact information.
            <img src="./business-writer-image.jpg" title="business-writer-image">
        </q>
        <p>
            I need a fake resume (ie. not my home address or any identifying information) to send this person
            because the ad is terrible. Pay isn't great, so I think I have a chance and a day or two to 
            make a resume and apply. I'm not a writer, but I can write. Not sure about this interview request.
        </p>
